Challenge: NASA Space Apps Challenge "Habitable Exoplanets: Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own"

Prediction Model:

To predict the planet type, accuracy, and planet type analysis using visualization of 3D graph with planet mass, planet radius, planet semi_major_axis, we can use the following Python libraries:

pandas: to read and manipulate the data
numpy: for mathematical operations
scikit-learn: for machine learning
seaborn: for data visualization
We can first use pandas to read the data into a DataFrame. Then, we can use numpy to calculate the planet type and accuracy. For the planet type analysis, we can use scikit-learn to train a machine learning model to predict the planet type based on the planet mass, planet radius, and planet semi-major-axis. Finally, we can use seaborn to create a 3D graph to visualize the planet type analysis.

Heat Map of Planet Temperature:

To create a heat map of planet temperature for habitability of an exoplanet, we can use the following steps:

Use pandas to read the data into a DataFrame.
Calculate the planet temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
Use seaborn to create a heat map of the planet temperature.
My Habitable World

Based on the above analysis, my habitable world is a rocky planet that orbits a Sun-like star in the habitable zone. It is about 1.5 times the size of Earth and has a radius of 1.2 times that of Earth. Its temperature ranges from -50 to 50 degrees Celsius, which is similar to Earth's temperatureÂ range.

My habitable world has a thick atmosphere that is composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with smaller amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases. The atmosphere is dense enough to protect the planet from harmful radiation from its star, but thin enough to allow sunlight to reach the surface.

The surface of my habitable world is mostly covered in water, with some landmasses. The oceans are teeming with life, and the landmasses are covered in lush forests and grasslands. The planet has a diverse ecosystem, with a wide variety of plants and animals.
